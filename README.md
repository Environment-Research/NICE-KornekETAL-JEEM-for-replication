This folder contains the software to the NICE model as used in the Kornek et al article "The social cost of carbon and inequality: When local redistribution shapes global carbon prices" published in JEEM.

Two versions of NICE have been created to represent the different scenarios in the article.

The folder 'NICE-MATLAB-master - nat subopt redist' contains a slightly modified version of the original NICE model to implement the scenario of nationally suboptimal tranfers.

The folder 'NICE-MATLAB-master - equality and nat opt redist' contains the modified NICE model to implement the scenario of nationally optimal transfers and of equality at the regional level.

To run either code, please see the individual README files in the folders.
