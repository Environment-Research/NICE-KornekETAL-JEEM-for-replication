This folder contains the software to the NICE model as used in the Kornek et al article "The social cost of carbon and inequality: When local redistribution shapes global carbon prices", Kornek et al JEEM (2021).

Two versions of NICE have been created to represent the different scenarios in the article.

The folder 'NICE-MATLAB-master - nat subopt redist' contains a modified version of the original NICE model to implement the scenario of nationally suboptimal transfers.

The folder 'NICE-MATLAB-master - equality and nat opt redist' contains the modified NICE model to implement the scenario of nationally optimal transfers and of equality at the regional level.

To run either code and for the terms of use, please see the individual README and LICENSE files in the folders.
